General notes:
======================================================

- This program executes A* algorhitm for assignment 3
- There are only two inputs - Starting city and Target City
- If City name is written incorrectly, an error will bw output
- Code was written in the Sublime Text editor. Because of that some part of the code and comments may be shifted
  and become a bit messy if opened in another editor such as vim or gedit

======================================================
